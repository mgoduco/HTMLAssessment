/* Stretch Goals
Have each team's primary quarterback display in bold.
Use CSS to give the table rows alternating background colors.
Solid background images can make foreground text hard to read; find
a way to have each team's image display behind its roster,
 but reduced intensity. Do not edit the image itself. */
